# Relevance Scoring - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What's New?

Related papers in **Citations** and **Recommendations** sections now have:
- **Color-coded backgrounds** (gold → yellow → blue → gray)
- **Icons** (🔥 flame or 📈 trending) for high-relevance papers
- **Thicker borders** (2px) for important papers
- **"Influential" badges** showing Semantic Scholar's proprietary impact metric

## 🔍 How to Read the Colors

| Look For | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Gold background + 🔥** | Highly relevant - start here! |
| **Yellow background + 📈** | Very relevant - check these next |
| **Light blue background** | Relevant - worth reviewing |
| **No special styling** | Related but lower impact |

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **Hover over icons** (🔥/📈) to see the exact relevance score (0-100)
2. **Look for "influential" badges** (orange) - these are Semantic Scholar's high-quality citation indicators
3. **Recommendations are pre-sorted** by Semantic Scholar's algorithm - papers at the top get bonus points
4. **Thicker borders** (2px instead of 1px) = score ≥50 = definitely worth checking

## 📊 What Makes a Paper "Highly Relevant"?

The algorithm considers:
- **Total citations**: How many times the paper has been cited
- **Influential citations**: Semantic Scholar's metric for high-quality citations
- **Position** (recommendations only): Earlier papers in the list are more relevant

## 🚀 Using This Feature

### For Literature Reviews
1. Open any paper in your list
2. Click on "Papers Citing This Work" or "Recommended Related Papers"
3. Look for gold/yellow cards first - these are your high-value papers
4. Click "Add to List" on interesting papers to analyze them

### For Finding Key Papers
- Papers with many **influential citations** (orange badges) are often seminal works in the field
- Gold-background papers (🔥) are likely to be important references
